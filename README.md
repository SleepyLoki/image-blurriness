# image-blurriness
By utilizing 2D arrays and its different methods, I built data that represents an image.
Through the different iterations of this challenge, such numbers (that represent colors) get altered throuh algorithms.

### Image Blur 1
Display an image, represented by 1's and 0's, onto the screen.

### Image Blur 2
Continuing from the image blur above, any 0's to the left of any number 1, shall be turned into 1's.

### Image Blue 3
Find all the 1's and turn any pixels  that can be reached by making 'n' moves or less using only left, right, up or down from the starting point.
